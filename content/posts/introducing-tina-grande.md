## Contributing

**BUILD** is a fantastic way to apply your knowledge gained from class to impact lives. We work in small teams to build technological solutions for nonprofits and local businesses. We are looking forward to the growth of **BUILD** as more people get involved. We have applications for business and project developers at the beginning of each semester.
